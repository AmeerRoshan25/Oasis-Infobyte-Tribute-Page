        <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July
          2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
          president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
          Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
          He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
          mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
          Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
          India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
          He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
          development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also
          played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
          Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
          test by India in 1974.

            Apart from his contributions to science and technology, Dr. Kalam was
            also a prolific writer and speaker. He authored several books,
            including "Wings of Fire" and "Ignited Minds," which have been
            inspiring millions of people worldwide. He believed in the power of
            youth and education in transforming society and worked tirelessly
            towards that vision even after his presidential tenure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Kalam received numerous awards and honors, including the Bharat
            Ratna, India's highest civilian award, for his exceptional
            contributions to the nation. He remains an enduring inspiration for
            generations to come.
